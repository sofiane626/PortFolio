The Java project I present is an object-oriented chess game, offering a modular design and well-organized structure. The chess pieces, such as king, queen, rooks, bishops, knights, and pawns, are represented by distinct classes, each inheriting from a common base class.

The main class of the game manages the chessboard, game rules, and facilitates interaction between players. Piece movements are governed by specific methods for each type of piece, ensuring a clear implementation of chess rules.

The use of concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism allows for code extensibility, making it easy to add future features. A game state management mechanism ensures precise tracking of different game phases, such as check, checkmate, and stalemate.

In summary, this project skillfully combines object-oriented programming principles to create a chess game in Java, providing a solid foundation for software extension, maintenance, and continuous improvement.
